Search for issues to make your first contribution for from your starred repos. With github search it is a lot of work to find issues that I am passionate about contributing to. This is intended to bridge this missing piece of personalised issues. All contributions to this project are welcome.

Also a commandline tool for this will be coming soon!!

## Running your local build

Add environment variables in .env file for
1. TOKEN - which should be set to the personal access token from github
2. PORT - which should be the port where you want to set your server.

## Installing dependancies

```npm install```

## Todo

- [x] Repo name is not being displayed(high-priority).  
- [x] Add star repo button in the site.  
- [x] Add labels to show beginner friendly issues
- [ ] Implement command line tool for the product.
